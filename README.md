# calculus-cli
A collection of interactive and semi-interactive CLI applications to perform integration, differentiation, and approximation written in various languages (Python, C and R).

The purpose behind creating these applications was to be able to perform various things with custom user input (equations, domains/ranges, etc.), then to automate processes such as the Trapezoidal Rule and Monte-Carlo integration approximations.
There are programs found here that can do a myriad of various things under the umbrella of calculus. They are listed in sections below:

### Integration Approximation
* Trapezoidal/Trapezium Rule (Python and C)
* Monte Carlo Simulation (Python)

Installation and Usage instructions can be found in the README.md of each application in their respective folders.
